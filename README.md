# Welcome to __Speak Like A Sommelier__

### This project was built to give amateur wine drinkers a near-professional language with which to describe the wine they are drinking. 

TL;DR This is how sommeliers describe wine, based on wine score. 

If you're like me when you first started drinking wine, the wine was either... good or bad. Over time, your sense of taste becomes more refined, you can pick up other flavors and smells. 

With this tool, you can REALLY expand your vocabulary by understanding how sommeliers -- some of the most qualified wine drinkers on earth -- understand and describe the wine they drink.
